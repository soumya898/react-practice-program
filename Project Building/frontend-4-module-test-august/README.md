Features & Requirements
Home Page:
Navbar: Display application title and navigation links to Home and History pages.
Search Functionality: Provide an input field where users can type in a word and a button to initiate the search. Display the results below the input

History Page:
Display a list of previously searched words.
History should be stored and managed in the Redux store.
Clicking on a word in the history list should redirect users to the word's details page.

Word Details Page:
Display detailed information of a word. This includes its phonetics, meanings, part of speech, definitions, and audio pronunciations.
Use dynamic routing to handle different words (`/word/:word`).

Loader:
Display a visually appealing loader/spinner while fetching data from the API.

Redux Integration:
Set up Redux for state management.
Create actions and reducers to manage the history of searched words.
Use Redux middleware (like `redux-thunk`) for asynchronous operations if necessary.
Note
Please Make sure your UI does not break and is handling all of the values as optional values, because sometimes words will directly have antonyms and synonyms that you need to handle. And sometimes they’ll have definitions, and those definitions will have a lot of antonyms and synonyms. Make sure all of your mapping is accurate and works. Sometimes there will be multiple audio files, sometimes there will be no audio files. Handle all of these edge cases properly.
